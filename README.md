WinniJPEG
=========

`WinniJPEG` is a boiler plate jpeg decoder written in c. It's quite boiler plate
as the description goes and might not work with all JPEG classes.
But it works fine with the attached test.jpg
Feel free to tweak and learn.

How to test
===========

cd qt_src
qmake
make
./WinniJPEG
